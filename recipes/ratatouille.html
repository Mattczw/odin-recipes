        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>Created by a rat</p>

        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon Butter</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Plain Flour</li>
            <li>250ml Milk</li>
            <li>250g Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Olive Oil</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon Chilli Flakes</li>
            <li>2 Garlic Cloves <em>crushed</em></li>
            <li>1 Green Courgette</li>
            <li>1 Yellow Courgette</li>
            <li>1 Aubergine</li>
            <li>1 Red Pepper</li>
            <li>1 Yellow Pepper</li>
            <li>1 medium Sweet Potato</li>
            <li>16 slices Salami</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon finely grated Parmesan</li>
            <li>Salt and Pepper</li>
            <li>handful of Basil</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 180˚C.</li>
            <li>Melt the butter in a saucepan over a medium heat, then add the flour and stir to make a paste. Let this cook for 3-4 minutes, stirring, before gradually adding the milk until you have a smooth béchamel sauce. Pour this sauce into the bottom of an ovenproof dish.</li>
            <li>Place a frying pan over a medium heat and add the olive oil, garlic and chilli flakes. Stir and cook whilst the pan heats up. Before the garlic gains colour, pour in the tomato sauce and 100ml water. Cook together until reduced a little, and slightly darkened and shiny. Pour this over the béchamel and set aside for the time being.</li>
            <li>Fit the vegetable slicer attachment, fitted with the medium blade, to the front outlet of your kitchen machine. Use this to slice your vegetables into rounds, keeping the different colours separate.</li>
            <li>Layer the vegetables alternately into stacks. Turn the stacks onto their sides and tuck them around the edge of the dish, with a slice of salami between each stack. Continue around the dish, then fill in the inside of the dish until all of the sauce is covered.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top with Parmesan and season with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 30-40 minutes, until vegetables are tender, the sauce is bubbling and the top is browned. Scatter with basil leaves to serve.</li>
        </ol>
